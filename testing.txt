UNIT TESTING

Function:
void simulate_time_period(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> &airportMap, int hour)

Description:
The function is supposed to simulate the changes during each hour interval. A unit test
will test: for each gate in the map, the function checks the list of arrivals (0), if 
there is an arrival flight, the functions moves the front arrival flight to the list 
of departures (1), flights in the departure list is removed (left airport), delayed
flights move back to departures, and new flights arriving.

    airportMap["Gate A1"][0].push_back("AA123"); // [0] = arrivals list
    airportMap["Gate A1"][1].push_back("AA124"); // [1] = departures list
    airportMap["Gate A1"][2].push_back("AA125"); // [2] = delays list

    airportMap["Gate B2"][0].push_back("BB101"); // [0] = arrivals list
    airportMap["Gate B2"][1].push_back("BB102"); // [1] = departures list
    airportMap["Gate B2"][2].push_back("BB103"); // [2] = delays list

void simulate_time_period(map<string, array<list<string>, 3>> &airportMap, int hour) {
    cout << "\n --- HOUR " << hour << " ---" << endl;

    // iterate through gates
    for (auto &gatePair : airportMap) {
        string gateName = gatePair.first;
        auto &flightLists = gatePair.second;

        // TEST, CHANGE ARRIVING FLIGHT TO DEPARTING
        if (!flightLists[0].empty()) {
            string flight = flightLists[0].front();
            flightLists[0].pop_front();         // remove from arrivals
            flightLists[1].push_back(flight);   // add to departures
            cout << "Flight " << flight << " moved from arrivals to departures at " << gateName << endl;
        }

        // 25% CHANCE THAT A DEPARTURE WILL BE DELAYED

        // 50% CHANCE THAT A DELAYED FLIGHT WILL BE CLEARED FOR DEPARTURE
    }
