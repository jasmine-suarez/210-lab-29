Project Overview:
My project simulates airport flight activity over time. The simulations shows how flights
arrive, depart, and encounter delays at multiple airport gates over 25 time periods (hours).
The program will demonstrate how flight statuses change as time passes.

Implementation:
I plan to use a std::map to store data for each airport gate. The map will have the gate
name as its key. The map's value will be an array of three std::lists representing arriving
flights, departing flights, and delayed flights.

Simulated Events:
The simulation will focus on three events: flights arrive (new flights are added to the "arrivals"
list), flights depart (flights move from "arrivals" to "departures"), and flight delay (adding
or removing from "delays"),
